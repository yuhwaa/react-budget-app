## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap

I developed this travel budget tracking app using a stack of HTML, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap. Leveraging the power of React's component-based architecture, I created an intuitive user interface for users to input and track their expenses effortlessly. Bootstrap ensured a responsive design for seamless usability on various devices. The result is a user-friendly app that simplifies trip budget management.

## Optimizations
Incorporating an "Uncategorized" expense category to capture unclassified expenses or those spanning multiple trips enhances the app's functionality. This feature not only promotes more accurate travel budgeting but also introduces greater adaptability, addressing diverse user needs effectively.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this app was a profound lesson in information organization and categorization. One key insight was the importance of including uncategorized expenses in the total expense calculation, which I initially overlooked. Recognizing this missing piece was a significant revelation, highlighting the potential blind spot it could create in the budgeting process. This experience reinforced the importance of thoroughness and attention to detail in both app development and personal finance management.
